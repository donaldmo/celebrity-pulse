To use Ngrok on Linux for HTTPS with your local development server, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Ngrok**

First, you'll need to download and install Ngrok on your Linux system.

1. **Download Ngrok:**
   - Visit the [Ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the Linux version.
   - Alternatively, you can use `wget` or `curl` to download directly from the terminal:

     ```bash
     wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
     ```

2. **Extract the Downloaded Archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
   ```

3. **Move Ngrok to `/usr/local/bin`:**

   ```bash
   sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/ngrok
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**

   ```bash
   ngrok version
   ```

   You should see the version of Ngrok installed.

### 2. **Set Up Ngrok**

1. **Sign Up for an Ngrok Account:**
   - Go to the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account.
   - After signing up, log in to your account to get your authtoken.

2. **Connect Ngrok with Your Account:**
   - Copy your authtoken from the Ngrok dashboard.
   - Run the following command to set up Ngrok with your account:

     ```bash
     ngrok config add-authtoken <your_authtoken>
     ```

### 3. **Run Ngrok with Your Local Server**

Assume you have a local development server running on port `3000` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Here's how to expose it over HTTPS using Ngrok:

1. **Start Your Local Server:**
   - Ensure your server is running locally on the desired port. For example, if youâ€™re using Node.js, run:

     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

2. **Start Ngrok:**
   - Use Ngrok to create an HTTPS tunnel to your local server:

     ```bash
     ngrok http 3000
     ```

3. **Get the Public URL:**
   - After running the above command, Ngrok will provide you with a forwarding URL. It will look something like this:

     ```
     Forwarding                    https://abcd1234.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
     ```

   - You can now use the `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io` URL to access your local server securely over the internet.

### 4. **Additional Options**

- **Custom Subdomain (Paid Plan Required):**
  - If you're on a paid Ngrok plan, you can use a custom subdomain:
  
    ```bash
    ngrok http -subdomain=mycustomname 3000
    ```

- **View Traffic Dashboard:**
  - Ngrok provides a web interface to inspect the traffic. You can access it at `http://localhost:4040`.

### 5. **Stop Ngrok**

- To stop Ngrok, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Ngrok is running.

Ngrok makes it very easy to test webhooks, share your local site, or debug apps in a secure and straightforward way.
